# Hack-the-change-hackathon

## Inspiration
Food waste and food insecurity are major issues and effective access to food is unattainable for many. Our goal is to create a barrier-free and safe access to food for the community. 
## What it does
The website provides donors the opportunity to donate extra food, and receivers the opportunity to pick up food without the extra barriers that come with food banks and pantries. 
## How we built it
We built it using html, css, python, Django, and mongoDB. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges when connecting the database to our website, connecting the various links and implementing our designs.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our adaptability and flexibility regarding our code design and implementation. Many of us were new to this, but we learned a lot. 
## What we learned
We learned more about working in a team, coding with a team, and implementing new concepts and languages, 
## What's next for CommuniFeed
Our next steps involve adding more features such as messaging, APIâ€™s for recipes and maps, and connecting with the community and government programs.
